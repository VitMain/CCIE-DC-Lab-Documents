# CCIE-DC-Lab-Documents
Configuration guides for CCIE DC v3.0 lab exam.

In this repo, you will find documents that show you how to configure various technologies found on the CCIE DC v3.0 lab exam. I personally compiled all of the documents, however the material in some of the documents was taken from various courses found on INE, Cisco Digital Learning, and Cisco DevNet Learning Labs. Therefore, much of the credit goes to INE and Cisco. I do not own some of the material that was used; INE and Cisco reserve all rights.

There is one issue that you will encounter (and this has been documented in the Issues section of the repo): some of the documents are unavailable to preview within GitHub (likely because of the size of the document), but they are still available for download. Happy learning!
