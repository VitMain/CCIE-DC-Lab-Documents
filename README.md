# CCIE-DC-Lab-Documents
Configuration guides for the CCIE DC v3.0 lab exam. Most of the material here will still be relevant for the v3.1 exam which will go live in April 2024.

In this repo, you will find documents that show you how to configure various technologies found on the CCIE DC v3.0 lab exam. I personally compiled all of the documents, however the material in some of the documents was taken from various courses found on INE, Cisco Digital Learning, and Cisco DevNet Learning Labs. Therefore, much of the credit goes to INE and Cisco. I do not own some of the material that was used; INE and Cisco reserve all rights.

There is one issue that you will encounter (and this has been documented in the Issues section of the repo): some of the documents are unavailable to preview within GitHub (because of the size of the document), but they are still available for download. Please use the 'Download raw file' button in the top right corner of the document page to download it locally. Happy learning!
