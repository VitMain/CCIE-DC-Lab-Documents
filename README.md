# CCIE-DC-Lab-Documents
Configuration guides for the CCIE DC v3.0 and v3.1 lab exams, and common Cisco data center tasks.

Most of the material here is for the v3.0 lab exam, but new material for the v3.1 lab exam will continue to be added. The repo will also continue to be updated periodically with other material that is relevant for any Cisco data center task.

In this repo, you will find documents that show you how to configure various technologies found on the CCIE DC v3.0 and v3.1 lab exams. I personally compiled all of the documents, however the material in some of the documents was taken from various courses found on INE, Cisco Digital Learning, and Cisco DevNet Learning Labs. Therefore, much of the credit goes to INE and Cisco. I do not own some of the material that was used; INE and Cisco reserve all rights.

There is one issue that you will encounter (and this has been documented in the Issues section of the repo): some of the documents are unavailable to preview within GitHub (because of the size of the document), but they are still available for download. Please use the 'Download raw file' button in the top right corner of the document page to download it locally. Happy learning!
