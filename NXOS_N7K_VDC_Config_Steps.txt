STEPS TO CONFIGURE VDC ON N7K
=============================

1. Log into switch and show the currently configured VDCs 

    N7K-1# show vdc

2. Check which interfaces are currently allocated to which VDCs 

    N7K-1# show vdc membership

3. Create a VDC

    N7K-1# conf t
    N7K-1(config)# vdc mr

4. Show the running-config of the newly created VDC, and make sure you have the correct linecard configured in the VDC

    N7K-1(config-vdc)# sh run vdc
    <output omitted>
    vdc mr id 4
    limit-resource module-type m1 m1xl m2xl f2e

5. If the correct linecard is not configured in the VDC, then configure it, othrwise skip this step

    N7K-1(config-vdc)# limit-resource module-type f3

6. Allocate interfaces to the VDC

    N7K-1(config-vdc)# allocate interface ethernet 1/1, eth4/1
    Entire port-group is not present in the command. Missing ports will be included automatically
    Moving ports will cause all config associated to them in source vdc to be removed. Are you sure you want to move the ports (y/n)?  [yes]

7. Verify that the interfaces have been properly allocated

    N7K-1(config-vdc)# show vdc membership
    <output omitted>
    vdc_id: 4 vdc_name: mr interfaces:
            Ethernet1/1           Ethernet1/3           Ethernet1/5
            Ethernet1/7

            Ethernet4/1

8. Switch to the newly created VDC and proceed through the system setup

    N7K-1(config-vdc)# switchto vdc mr


            ---- System Admin Account Setup ----


    Do you want to enforce secure password standard (yes/no) [y]: n

    Enter the password for "admin":
    Confirm the password for "admin":

            ---- Basic System Configuration Dialog VDC: 4 ----

    This setup utility will guide you through the basic configuration of
    the system. Setup configures only enough connectivity for management
    of the system.

    Please register Cisco Nexus7000 Family devices promptly with your
    supplier. Failure to register may affect response times for initial
    service calls. Nexus7000 devices must be registered to receive
    entitled support services.

    Press Enter at anytime to skip a dialog. Use ctrl-c at anytime
    to skip the remaining dialogs.

    Would you like to enter the basic configuration dialog (yes/no): no

9. Show the interface status

    N7K-1-mr# show int stat

10. Enable any disabled interfaces

    N7K-1-mr# conf t
    Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
    N7K-1-mr(config)# int eth1/1, eth4/1
    N7K-1-mr(config-if-range)# no shut

11. Verify that the interfaces have now been enabled

    N7K-1-mr(config-if-range)# show int stat

12. If you ever need to switch back to the admin VDC, run the below command

    N7K-1-mr# switchback
